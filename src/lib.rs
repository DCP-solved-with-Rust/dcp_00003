/*
 * The question did not specify a format for the string representation,
 * so we'll pick one ourselves. We choose JSON because it is widespread
 * and it fits the bill in terms of being a string representation capable
 * of de/serializing nested objects. No reason to invent our own syntax I say.
 *
 * We will be using the JSON support of the serialization and deserialization
 * framework Serde. Is this fine or is this cheating? ... On one hand I suppose
 * the purpose of these coding problems is to test our knowledge, and an interviewer
 * might want to see if we understand the fundamentals of the concept of serialization
 * and deserialization. On the other hand, every line of code that we don't have to
 * write is one less line of code to worry about maintaining, and also why waste time
 * rewriting something that already exists if the existing thing fits the bill?
 *
 * Lines of code add up, and the pain of maintaining a codebase is real. So I am
 * going to go with "let's use an appropriate framework or library" for $500 :)
